This is a set of test cases that are written as part of the LinkedBrainz project [6] to test 
the Music Brainz NGS [1] to Music Ontology [2] (etc. [3]) mapping. See also [5].

Install instruction:

0. The project is written in Java and makes use of the JUnit test framework [7], Jena Semantic 
   Web framework [8] and JDBC database handling framework [9].
1. The project is a Maven [10] project, so you can relatively easily load the dependencies.
2. You have to setup the DB connection settings (host, port, db-name, username, password) in 
   linkedbrainz.testcases.Utils.java, which are right on the top.
